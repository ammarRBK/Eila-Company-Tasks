Third Task

You will need to add an authentication layer to your API (look into http://passportjs.org). Once you do that, you should end up with a header called ‘Authorization’ that takes a value of  “someAuthorizationToken”.

someToken would look something like this:  

eyJ0sdAiOksl1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE1MjMzNTAyOTMsImlhdCI6MTUyMDc3MDI5Mywic3ViIjoiNWFhNTExN2I0ZDhlMjcyY2U0YTZlMGFlIn0.1f-AAAXHTgzfEn-R6MB1W31_F2umR_Gej9UnJ2eGOOA

After adding the authentication layer, add a new endpoint to your api that is called 'pirates/countPirates’. *note that this should be authenticated

When this countPirates is called, it should call this public API  https://eila-pirate-api.herokuapp.com/pirates/prison this API will return a JSON that contains an array of “faces” just like the array that was used in the first task.

Use the same function you wrote in the first task to count the valid pirate faces and return a JSON that looks like {“piratesFound”:X} where ‘X' is the number of pirates found. 

Once you are done, send: “I be a buccaneer” to Eila and follow the instructions.
