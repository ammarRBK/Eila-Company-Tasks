Second Task

You will need to create a RESTful API using Node.js using Express, mongoDB (e.g: mLab) that has 1 route ‘/pirates’ that returns the data that is in the JSON below.

Please note that in order to pass this task, ‘GET /pirates’ should contain only the data that is in the JSON below.

Once you are done, please deploy your app to http://heroku.com, and send a message to Eila saying “Avast ye” and follow the instructions given. 

Make sure you are using Git 😉
